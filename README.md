# Mario-With-A-Gun
A simple game that is a reimagining of the 1985 Super Mario Bros. The game incorporates guns and takes place in a nuclear apocalyptic setting. Was a project submitted for a hackathon competition. Created with a group in Python using Pygame 

## What was learned and how the project was made

* Used Sprite sheets to animate the player and enemies

* Learned more about Pygame and how you can use external platforms in conjunction with a programming language

* Learned how to create logic for movement of player and develop in game collision physics for background obejcts and enemies

* Had to work with a team to complete the task

* There was a limited deadline and my team was forced to make changes to cater to this deadline

* Had to implement external custom resources such as soundtracks and visuals
